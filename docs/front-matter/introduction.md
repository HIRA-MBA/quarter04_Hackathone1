# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Physical AI merges machine learning with robotics—systems that perceive, reason, and act in the real world. Humanoid robots represent the pinnacle: bipedal balance, dexterous manipulation, and human-like interaction.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI encompasses:
- **Perception**: Cameras, LIDAR, force sensors, proprioception
- **Reasoning**: Planning, prediction, adaptation
- **Action**: Precise movement, balance, manipulation
- **Learning**: Improvement through simulation and real-world experience

## Course Structure

### Module 1: ROS 2 Foundations (Ch 1-5)
Robot middleware, sensor integration, URDF modeling, edge deployment.

### Module 2: Digital Twins (Ch 6-7)
Gazebo physics simulation, Unity visualization, ROS 2 bridge.

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac (Ch 8-10)
GPU-accelerated simulation, perception pipelines, sim-to-real transfer.

### Module 4: VLA Models (Ch 11-14)
Bipedal locomotion, manipulation, vision-language-action integration.

## Prerequisites

- **Python** proficiency (C++ helpful)
- **Math**: Linear algebra, calculus basics
- **Linux**: Ubuntu 22.04, command-line familiarity
- **ML basics** helpful for later modules

## How to Use This Book

1. Read chapters sequentially—each builds on previous
2. Complete all lab exercises
3. Use the AI chatbot for questions
4. Build the capstone project

The journey is challenging but rewarding. Let's begin.
