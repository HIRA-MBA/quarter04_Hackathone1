# Foreword

We stand at a pivotal moment in the history of robotics and artificial intelligence. After decades of progress in software-based AI—from expert systems to deep learning to large language models—the field is now turning its attention to **Physical AI**: the embodiment of intelligence in machines that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world.

## The Convergence of Technologies

The emergence of humanoid robotics as a viable commercial endeavor is not accidental. It represents the convergence of several technological breakthroughs:

- **Advanced Simulation**: Physics engines like NVIDIA Isaac Sim enable training robots in virtual environments at millions of times real-world speed
- **Foundation Models**: Vision-language models provide robots with semantic understanding of their environment
- **Efficient Hardware**: Modern actuators, sensors, and edge computing platforms make capable robots economically feasible
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Algorithms that can discover complex motor skills through trial and error

What was once confined to research laboratories is now being deployed in warehouses, factories, and soon, our homes.

## Why Humanoid Form?

The choice of humanoid form for robots is deliberate and pragmatic. Our built environment—from door handles to staircases to tools—is designed for the human body. A humanoid robot can navigate and manipulate this environment without requiring costly modifications. More importantly, the humanoid form enables intuitive human-robot collaboration, leveraging our innate ability to understand and predict human-like motion.

## The Skills Gap

As this industry grows, there is an acute need for engineers who understand the full stack of humanoid robotics: from low-level motor control to high-level AI reasoning. This textbook addresses that need by providing a comprehensive curriculum that bridges theory and practice.

The students who master this material will be uniquely positioned to contribute to one of the most exciting technological frontiers of our time.

## A Note on Learning

Robotics is fundamentally an applied discipline. While theory provides the foundation, true understanding comes from building, testing, and iterating. This textbook emphasizes hands-on learning through simulation and, where possible, physical hardware. I encourage readers to experiment beyond the provided exercises, to break things and fix them, and to develop an intuition for the physical world that no amount of theory can replace.

The robots of tomorrow will be built by those who start learning today.
